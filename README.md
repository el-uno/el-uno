# 🕶️ Welcome to My Playground  

"Stare into the code. Break the code. Rebuild the code. Repeat."  

Not your average dev. I live where consensus meets chaos — bending blockchains until they confess their secrets. Security researcher, on-chain builder, and chaos engineer with a knack for finding cracks in the armor (and sometimes creating a few of my own).  


## ⚡ About Me  
- 🔐 **Blockchain Security**: Breaking, hardening, and stress-testing smart contracts before the exploiters do.  
- ⚔️ **Offense + Defense**: I think like a hacker, code like a builder, and secure like a paranoid auditor.  
- 🚀 **On-Chain Chaos**: From testnet to mainnet, I launch code that laughs at latency and thrives under pressure.  
- 🧩 **Code Alchemist**: Solidity, Rust, TypeScript, python — I don’t just write code, I weaponize it.

## 🛠️ Arsenal  
- **Audits**: Finding logic bombs, race conditions, and hidden foot-guns.  
- **Exploits**: Crafting PoCs that make bug bounty hunters jealous.  
- **Protocols**: From DeFi degeneracy to zero-knowledge sorcery.  
- **Infra**: Nodes, bots, MEV strategies, and the dark arts of gas
